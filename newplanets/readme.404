plan404 ephemerides

The tables of coefficients were derived by a least squares fit of
periodic terms to JPL's DE404 ephemerides.  The periodic
frequencies used were determined by spectral analysis and
comparison with VSOP87 and other analytical planetary theories. 
The least squares fit to DE404 covers the interval from -3000 to
+3000 for the outer planets, and -1350 to +3000 for the inner
planets.

The files mer404.c, ven404.c, ..., plu404.c contain numerical
tables for computing the J2000 heliocentric ecliptic longitude,
latitude, and distance of the indicated planet.  Each file
includes a table of statistics from a comparison with DE404.
Maximum deviations from DE404 are shown, in arc seconds, over each
interval of 500 Julian years. The figure tabulated for deviation
in radial distance is scaled relative to the mean distance; to
convert to astronomical units, multiply by 4.848e-6 times the
mean distance in au.

The lunar ephemeris files mlr404.c and mlat404.c generate
positions relative to the mean equinox and ecliptic of date.
They assume the DE403 precession constants used in precess.c
and the obliquity in epsiln.c.  These differ somewhat from DE200
or IAU constants but are thought to be more accurate.
